# Osyris

A Project Management App built on React and a tiny Python Flask Backend meant to address the following use cases:
1. Manage multiple projects with multiple team members at task level
2. Central place for documenting all project timelines
3. Preserve what happened in the past, how much time it took to achieve it so that future timelines can be better formulated
4. Get an overall perspective of what is happening now, what is next to come and how far into the future we have visibility
5. Better manage utilization of team members
